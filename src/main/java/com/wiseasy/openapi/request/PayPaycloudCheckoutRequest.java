 * @Description: The merchant wants to use PayCloud's hosted checkout for payment, redirecting users to PayCloud's checkout page. To achieve this functionality,
 * the merchant can request this API. It will collect the user's order information, save the order within the PayCloud system, and synchronously return the checkout page URL "pay_url".
 * The merchant can then redirect users to this page, where users will input their payment details and complete the payment.
